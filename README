I got tired of dealing with browsers that don't support native JSON.parse() and JSON.stringify() methods, so I created this project. It detects if JSON is currently present, and if not, creates a new object called JSON, with stringify and parse methods.

Using it is super easy. Just add it to any project, and add:

<script type="text/javascript" src="/js/json-compat.js"></script>
